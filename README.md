# Landing-Page

This is a landing-page that has a unique design and elements that are aligned evenly
along the page that give it an attractive look to viewers. It contains some images,
text, and background colors that encapsulates the typical layout of a website you come across
across everyday. A major component for this project is flexbox and it helps give the
site its proper layout design.

This project is built using HTML and CSS.
